# MERN Full Stack Project
Building a personal finance tracker app using MERN stack, covering user authentication, database integration, and 
best practices for scalable React applications, with detailed code explanations and a complete backend setup using MongoDB.

## Tools used:
1. Backend: Utilized Node.js and Express.js. Mongoose used for MongoDB object modeling.
2. Frontend: Built with React, employing React Hooks and Context API for state management.
3. User Management: User authentication and management done by Clerk, streamlining the integration of secure user login and registration.
4. Database: MongoDB is used to store data, providing a cloud-hosted solution for managing the app's database.

The app is separated into client and server folders, with the client holding React project files and the server handling the backend. 
Here, Yarn and Vite are used instead of Create React App. Backend is set up using Express and TypeScript. 

The app includes user authentication through Clerk, with options for sign-in via Google, phone number, AppleID, and email address. 
Users can add expenses or income, view their monthly total, and edit or delete entries. 

## Key Insights:
-  Setting up user authentication with Clerk simplifies the process and improves security.
-  Properly structuring React components and routes enhances code organisation and readability.
-  Integrating MongoDB with Mongoose allows for easy database setup and management.
-  Defining schema and models in Mongoose ensures data consistency and clarity.
-  Implementing financial record form and list components enables user input and data display.
-  Utilising Express for the backend server provides a solid foundation for API development.
